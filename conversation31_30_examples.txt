user: Give me 30 examples like this but with different input and output according to the input. Name then accordingly Input1... Output1..., Input2... Output2... . Input: Keep searching a list until an item with the highest value is found. Remove the item. Output: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]. Remember to create various length graphs
assistant: Sure! Here are 30 different examples with various inputs and outputs, each represented by a different input and output sequence. The input graphs have different lengths and follow the requested structure:

Example 1:
Input1: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output1: The item with the highest value is found and removed.

Example 2:
Input2: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> E[End]
Output2: The item with the highest value is found but not removed.

Example 3:
Input3: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output3: No item with the highest value is found.

Example 4:
Input4: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End] E --> A
Output4: The item with the highest value is found and removed, and the search continues.

Example 5:
Input5: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> F[End]
Output5: The search ends without finding an item with the highest value.

Example 6:
Input6: A[Start] --> G[Search the list] G --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output6: The item with the highest value is found and removed, following a different search path.

Example 7:
Input7: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output7: The item with the highest value is found and removed immediately.

Example 8:
Input8: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> E[End]
Output8: The item with the highest value is found immediately but not removed.

Example 9:
Input9: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> E[End]
Output9: The search ends without checking if an item with the highest value is found.

Example 10:
Input10: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End] E --> A
Output10: The item with the highest value is found and removed, and the search continues in a loop.

Example 11:
Input11: A[Start] --> F[End]
Output11: The list is empty, no search is performed.

Example 12:
Input12: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> F[End]
Output12: The list is empty, no item with the highest value is found.

Example 13:
Input13: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> F[End]
Output13: The list only contains one item, which is with the highest value and is removed.

Example 14:
Input14: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> G[Search the list] G --> C
Output14: The search continues after a failed attempt to find the item with the highest value.

Example 15:
Input15: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End] E --> F[End]
Output15: The item with the highest value is found and removed, ending the search.

Example 16:
Input16: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> G[Remove the item] G --> E[End]
Output16: The item with the highest value is found and removed immediately after the search begins.

Example 17:
Input17: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> G[Search the list] G --> C
Output17: The first search fails, but the second search finds the item with the highest value.

Example 18:
Input18: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- No --> F[End]
Output18: The same search path is repeated, but no item with the highest value is found.

Example 19:
Input19: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> E[End] E --> F[End]
Output19: The item with the highest value is found immediately, and the search ends.

Example 20:
Input20: A[Start] --> G[Search the list] G --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output20: The item with the highest value is found and removed, following a different search path.

Example 21:
Input21: A[Start] --> G[Search the list] G --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output21: The item with the highest value is found and removed, following a different search path.

Example 22:
Input22: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> G[Search the list] G --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output22: The item with the highest value is found and removed after a secondary search.

Example 23:
Input23: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> H[End]
Output23: The list is empty, and no item with the highest value is found.

Input24: A[Start] --> I[Search the list] I --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> B C -- Yes --> D[Remove the item] D --> E[End]
Output24: The item with the highest value is found and removed, following a different search path.

Example 25:
Input25: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> C{Item with the highest value found?} C -- No --> I[End]
Output25: The list is empty, and no item with the highest value is found.

Example 26:
Input26: A[Start] --> J[End]
Output26: The search ends without starting since the list is empty.

Example 27:
Input27: A[Start] --> B[Search the list] B --> E[End]
Output27: The search ends without checking if an item with the highest value is found since the list is empty.

Example 28:
